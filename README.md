# ADM-HW2

In the main branch we can find three different file: a folder file called "code for additional months", a jupyter file called "Main.ipynb" and a pdf file called "Report_HW2".

In the jupyter file, we can find the code for the two the month October 2019 and November 2019. Inside the file, we can find at the beginning the question 3-5-6 and then we have the question 1-2-4-7. We have these order because we otherwise we lost the output of code.

In the folder file ("code for additional months"), we can find the code for the rest of the month December 2019, January 2020, February 2020, March 2020 and April 2020. We have a single jupyter file for each months and here the file are also split for group of quesiton. Hence, we have for each month two different file for the exercise number 3-5-6 and 1-2-4-7.

Finally, the pdf file is the report with all the result and some plot of the result of our analysis.
